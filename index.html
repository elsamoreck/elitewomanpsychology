                <p>When you audition for her approval, you unconsciously communicate several attraction-killing messages:</p>

                    <li><strong>Desperation:</strong> You need this to work out more than she does</li>
                    <li><strong>No Options:</strong> You're putting all your eggs in one basket</li>
                    <li><strong>Weak Frame:</strong> Your confidence depends on her validation</li>

                    <li>Is she emotionally mature and self-aware?</li>
                    <li>Does she bring positive energy to the interaction?</li>
                    <li>Would introducing her to my friends and family be a positive experience?</li>
